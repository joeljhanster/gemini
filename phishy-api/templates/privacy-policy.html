			<h1>Phishy Privacy Policy</h1>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>
				This privacy policy describes how Phishy, a Chrome extension developed
				by MrHanTheMan ("we" or "us"), collects, uses, and stores your
				information when you use our extension.
			</p>

			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

			<p>
				Phishy collects the following information from your browsing activity:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>URLs:</strong></li>
				<p>
					When you visit a webpage, Phishy analyzes the URLs of links present on
					that page. We do not collect the content of the webpages themselves.
				</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>Use of Information</h2>

			<p>We use the collected URLs for the following purposes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Phishing Detection:</strong></li>
				<p>
					We send the URLs to our secure API powered by Gemini, an AI model
					trained to detect phishing attempts. Gemini analyzes the
					characteristics of the URLs to determine if they are suspicious. We do
					not use the URLs for any other purpose besides phishing detection.
				</p>
				<li><strong>Analysis and Improvement (Optional):</strong></li>
				<p>
					We may use anonymized data (without any user identification) to
					analyze phishing trends and improve the accuracy of our detection
					system. This helps us better protect users from future phishing
					attempts.
				</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Storage</h2>

			<p>
				We take the security and privacy of your information seriously. Here's
				how we store the collected data:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>URLs:</strong></li>
				<p>
					The URLs you visit are temporarily stored while being analyzed by
					Gemini. We do not store them long-term and they are not associated
					with any user identifier.
				</p>
				<li><strong>API Response:</strong></li>
				<p>
					The response received from Gemini regarding the suspiciousness of a
					URL might be stored for a limited period for analysis purposes. This
					data is anonymized and does not contain any user identification.
				</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>User Control</h2>

			<p>
				Currently, Phishy does not offer options for users to directly manage
				the data collected. However, you can always uninstall the extension if
				you are uncomfortable with the data collection practices.
			</p>

			<h2>Security</h2>

			<p>
				We take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from
				loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
				destruction. We use HTTPS to encrypt communication between your browser
				and our API.
			</p>

			<h2>Contact Us</h2>

			<p>
				If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us
				at gemini.phishy@gmail.com.
