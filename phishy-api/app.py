Always double-check the URL and make sure it\'s exactly what you expect.\n\n2. **Typo Trap:**  These sneaky "phishy" folks are hoping you\'ll make a typo when typing a website address. They register domain names with common misspellings, like "gooogle.com" instead of "google.com," hoping to catch unsuspecting users who accidentally mistype the address. \n\n3. **Too Many "o"s:**  While there are legitimate websites with repeated letters, excessive repetition is often a red flag. "Phishy" websites might use extra letters to try and make their domain name look more convincing or to make it harder to spot the difference from the real website. \n\nAnything else you\'d like to explore about these "phishy" clues or how to stay safe online?'
